# MySQLChatbot

The code defines a Streamlit application that allows users to chat with a large language model (LLM) about a MySQL database. Users can connect to the database by providing credentials in the sidebar. The LLM(MistralAI) is then able to answer the user's questions about the database schema and generate SQL queries to retrieve data.
